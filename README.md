# SRL-Research-Project

This repository contains the complete dataset and analysis scripts used in the study **"Rethinking Self-Regulated Learning in Chatbot-Based Education with the Gen-SRL Framework."**  
It provides resources for replicating our findings, exploring the Gen-SRL framework, and applying microlevel SRL analysis to AI-mediated student–Chatbot interactions.

## 📁 Repository Structure

### 1. `Dataset/`
This folder contains the complete annotated dataset used in the study.  
- The dataset includes 894 student–ChatGPT prompts manually labeled using the Gen-SRL framework.
- Each data entry includes macro-level SRL phase and corresponding micro-level action.

### 2. `Data preprocessing and analysis scripts/`
This folder includes all scripts used to:
- Preprocess and clean raw annotation data
- Perform frequency analysis
- Apply process mining (e.g., generate models and visualizations)
- Reproduce key findings in the paper

> 💡 You can use these scripts to explore SRL patterns in other chatbot-based learning datasets by adjusting input files and parameters.
